CNREZ.EXE is a sample program that demonstrates setting up a simple container.
It creates a standard window with a container as a child of the client window.
Once created, records are inserted into the container and the window is
displayed.

Child records are created under each top-level record to demonstrate the Tree
view.

Once the container is displayed, Name, Icon, Detail and Text views are
selectable from an actionbar pulldown. Simple direct-editing is enabled.

This sample is meant to demonstrate the setting up of a container and nothing
more. Drag/drop, Context Menus, Shared records, Deltas, Ownerdraw are just some
of the things *not* covered here. I hope to upload a sample with these features
at a later date.

DISCLAIMER: This program intentionally does no error-checking and uses global
variables. This is to provide an easy to understand program flow. I do not like
to code this way and had to kick myself several times while coding it, but the
clarity is better this way.

Hopefully CNREZ will be of some use to beginning container programmers.

In order to feel good about myself<g>, I coded up another sample in CNRBAS.ZIP
that I am uploading at the same time as CNREZ. CNRBASE uses extensive error-
checking and uses window words to get rid of those nasty global variables. It
recursively displays all the files in a directory and its subdirectories,
using a secondary thread to keep the container available to the user while
filling it with records.
